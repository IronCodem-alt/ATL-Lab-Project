### **😕 Problem Statement**
There is too much pollution in the oceans and we cannot manually pick up all the garbage. This can be solved using robots to clean the oceans. But the problem is, how will the robot know what to collect and what-not?

### **💡 Problem Solution**
We can use Computer Vision AI to help the robot identify garbage in the oceans so that the life under water stays safe. In short, I am aiming to create a CV Project to help the robot identify trash and other garbages to help clean the oceans!

### **🌏 Sustainability Goal**
We plan on implementing the "Life Below Water" SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) which is the 14th of the 17 total. This means that we aim to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.
